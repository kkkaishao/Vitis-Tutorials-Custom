# Xilinx Versal Common Images

Download the pre-built PetaLinux images for Xilinx Versal devices from the following link:

[Common Images for Embedded Vitisâ„¢ Platforms - 2025.1  Full Product Installation](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-design-tools.html)

It needs license agreement to download the images, so it's unable to provide a download script here.

After downloading the images, extract all the files to the current directory.

For example, execute the following command in current directory:
```bash
tar -xzvf /path/to/xilinx-versal-common-<version>.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C .
```

Also, current folder contains a pre-compiled device tree file `system.dtb`, which has a workaround for the SD card issue. When you try to boot the PetaLinux from SD card on ALINX VD100 board, you may encounter a mmc issue as follows:

```

You can use this file directly in your PetaLinux project to fix the issue. It limits the maximum clock frequency of the SD card to 50MHz.

However, customize device tree file for you own project is also recommended. Finding out the solution of a specific issue do help you understand the hardware and software better.
