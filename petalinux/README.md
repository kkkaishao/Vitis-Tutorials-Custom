It needs license agreement to download the images, so it's unable to provide a download script here.

After downloading the images, extract all the files to the current directory.

For example, execute the following command in current directory:
```bash
tar -xzvf /path/to/xilinx-versal-common-<version>.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C .
